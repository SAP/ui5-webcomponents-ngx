# Difference from underlying library

All the functionality from the `@ui5/webcomponents` is also available in this library, but for enhanced adaptation, some parts have their own ways for dealing with commonly used features.

All the differences are listed on this page:

- [Event names](#outputevents-names)
- [Boolean input values](#boolean-input-values)
- [Component imports](#component-imports)

### Output(events) names

First of all, all the events which exist in `@ui5/webcomponents` are also available for the Angular components.
Every event name will be transformed to the schema `ui5${pascalCase(originalEventName)}`, so for example, if in [UI5 Web Components Documentation](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/) you see event name `selected-dates-change`, then for the wrapper component
the event name will be `ui5SelectedDatesChange`. In most cases, you will not have to think about it, since all the properties and outputs are typed for Angular users and your IDE will give you autocompletion
for all of them.


### Component imports

In `@ui5/webcomponents` in order to use the component, you should import it as needed, but in `@ui5/webcomponents-ngx` you can import components as a module, as well as standalone components.
The standalone components are exported from their respective directories, so you can import them like this:

```typescript
import { ButtonComponent } from '@ui5/webcomponents-ngx/main/button';
```
These components can be used as standard standalone components, or if you want to import all the components that are in for example `main` package, you can do it like this:

```typescript
import { Ui5MainModule } from '@ui5/webcomponents-ngx/main';
```
And then you should use them in your `NgModule` just like any other Angular module.

Besides `Ui5MainModule`, there are also `Ui5FioriModule` and `Ui5WebcomponentsModule`, which contains all available components.

### Content density

In order to set the `compact` mode, you can use the `[ui5Compact]` directive from `@ui5/webcomponents-ngx/content-density`

```ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { CompactDirective } from '@ui5/webcomponents-ngx/content-density';
import { ButtonComponent } from '@ui5/webcomponents-ngx/main/button';

@Component({
  selector: 'some-component',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [CompactDirective, ButtonComponent],
  template: `<ui5-button (click)="compact = !compact" [ui5Compact]="compact">Toggle compact</ui5-button>`,
})
export class SomeComponent {
  compact = false;
}
```
