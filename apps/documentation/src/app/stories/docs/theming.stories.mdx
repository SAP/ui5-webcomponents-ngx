The theme is a way to customize the look and feel of the components. It is a set of colors and typography styles that are used by the components.
`@ui5/webcomponents-ngx` supports all the themes, that are available in `@ui5/webcomponents` library, just recommended way of activating them is a little different from the one in `@ui5/webcomponents` library.
