# Theming

The theme is a way to customize the look and feel of the components. It is a set of colors and typography styles that are used by the components.
`@ui5/webcomponents-ngx` supports all the themes, that are available in `@ui5/webcomponents` library, just recommended way of activating them is a little different from the one in `@ui5/webcomponents` library.

## Supported Themes

`@ui5/webcomponents-ngx` supports all the themes, that are available in `@ui5/webcomponents` library, you can check the list [here](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/playground/advanced/configuration/#theme)

## Usage

For using theming you should have package `@ui5/theming-ngx` installed.

> **note:** `@ui5/theming-ngx` is a peer dependency of `@ui5/webcomponents-ngx` and it is not installed automatically, but if you installed `@ui5/webcomponents-ngx` with the `ng add` schematic, it will be installed automatically.

First, you need to import the theming module in your root module and use it like this:

```typescript
import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";
import { Ui5ThemingModule } from "@ui5/theming-ngx";

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    Ui5ThemingModule.forRoot({
      defaultTheme: "sap_horizon"
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

After that, it will initialize the theme in application startup.

### Theme Switching

If you want to switch the theme dynamically, you can use the `Ui5ThemingService` service:

```typescript
import { Component } from "@angular/core";
import { Ui5ThemingService } from "@ui5/theming-ngx";

@Component({
  selector: "app-root",
  template: `<ui5-button (click)="switchTheme()">Switch</ui5-button>`,
})
export class AppComponent {
  constructor(private ui5ThemingService: Ui5ThemingService) {}

  switchTheme() {
    this.ui5ThemingService.setTheme("sap_fiori_3");
  }
}
```

## Custom Themes

If you want to use a custom theme, you need to write your own theme provider. Custom theme provider needs to implement the `Ui5ThemingProvider` interface:

```typescript
import { inject, Injectable, OnDestroy } from "@angular/core";
import { Observable, of } from "rxjs";
import { Ui5ThemingService, Ui5ThemingProvider } from "@ui5/theming-ngx";

@Injectable()
export class CustomThemeProvider implements Ui5ThemingProvider, OnDestroy {
  protected availableThemes = ['some_theme'];

  protected _globalThemingService: Ui5ThemingService | null = inject(Ui5ThemingService, {optional: true});

  /** @hidden */
  constructor(
  ) {
      this._globalThemingService?.registerProvider(this);
  }

  /** @hidden */
  ngOnDestroy(): void {
    this._globalThemingService?.unregisterProvider(this);
  }

  supportsTheme(theme: string): boolean {
    return this.getAvailableThemes().includes(theme);
  }

  getAvailableThemes(): string[] {
    return this.availableThemes;
  }

  setTheme(theme: string): Observable<boolean> {
    if (!this.supportsTheme(theme)) {
      return of(false);
    }
    // implement theme injection logic here
  }
}

```

After that, you need to provide it in your root module and inject it somewhere in your application:

```typescript
import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";
import { Ui5ThemingModule } from "@ui5/theming-ngx";

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    Ui5ThemingModule.forRoot({
      defaultTheme: "some_theme"
    }),
  ],
  providers: [
    CustomThemeProvider
  ]
})
export class AppModule {
  constructor(private customThemeProvider: CustomThemeProvider) {}
}
```
